Wood milling project to create a small oval box 
as a gift for my mother.

This was my first project using SolidWorks for CAD & CAM, having moved over from Fusion360.

The top was milled in 3 steps:

1. The bottom side, inside lip was created, and the external perimeter was milled, but only a few millimeters deep.  The external blank perimeter was kept to allow consistent datuming when the blank is flipped.  Creating these two features together allows the best exterior line when the box is closed.  The upper and lower halves will match up fairly well.

1. The blank was flipped and the top was completely milled.  When this setup was complete, the oval top was free of the rectangular blank.

1. The blank was flipped back to upside down as in step 1. A fixture was built (see fixture CAD) to locate the top via the lip.  The part was pressed up into the fixture with shims to wedge it in. The interior was then milled out.  The fixture as later laser etched to capture the location of the box center relative to the corner of the fixture for easy locating.

The box was finished by wet sanding with Tung Oil, with progressively finer sandpaper: 220, 400, 600 and finally 1500 grit.  

The monogram was milled in with a 60 degree V-bit after finishing, and the milled area was oiled again.

The interior was laser etched with birthday message.
